There is a lot to be said about youth but I would like to focus this piece on negative pressure due to social media. Because of the advancement in technology, we have greater access to information, opportunities, networking, marketing, etc. Practically everything and anything can be accessed much faster and, naturally, we tend to expect things to be done quickly and faster. This ideal, of course, does not reflect real life and real living.

 

Our world is greatly influenced by the pressures of social media. The pressures of having to “make it in life” by a certain time and/or by a given age. Young people usually use social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram to boastfully display their accomplishments rather than the process they went through to attain their achievements These messages can either motivate or demotivate other young people.

 

In my view, 70 percent of the time, these messages result in negative peer pressure with regards to the choices that young people make. The pressure to attain a certain lifestyle or to hang out with certain groups of people. The pressure to have a certain body shape…the perfect body.  The pressure to drive specific types of cars, to live in specified neighbourhoods or types of house. The pressure to travel to top holiday destinations.

 

This copycat syndrome means that it is no longer “Fake it until you make it” but rather “Fake it as if you have made it”. Most experiences documented on social media are expensive and many young people, in their attempt to conform to these unrealistic social media portrayals end up in debt and some, in prison. In extreme circumstances, this has led to depression and other mental health issues.

 

Young people need to speak out about these issues. We need to use these very social media platforms to share real and inspirational testimonies. We need to appreciate that life is a journey with several milestones. Yes, we need to be successful but we should stop putting pressure on ourselves to achieve these milestones by certain times. There is a time for everyone! Your time will surely come.
