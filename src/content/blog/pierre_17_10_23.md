## Introduction
The digital age has opened the floodgates of opportunities for young people, but it has also unleashed a plethora of risks. From the perils of substance abuse to the horrors of cyberbullying, our youth navigate through a digital landscape fraught with danger. This third post in our series exposes these risky realms, informed by the latest findings from our HAZEYouth survey. 

The chart below displays the percentage of respondents who identified each challenge as a significant concern in their lives.

## Drugs, Alcohol, and Sex: The Dangers of Substance Abuse for Young People 
Substance abuse, including alcohol, tobacco, and drug use, is a major challenge for young people, identified by 30.4% of the respondents. It can have a significant impact on their physical and mental health, education, and social relationships. There are a number of factors that can contribute to substance abuse in young people, including:

1.	Peer pressure: Young people may feel pressure to use substances in order to fit in with their friends.
2.	Stress: Young people may use substances as a way to cope with stress from school, family, or other areas of their lives.
3.	Curiosity: Young people may be curious about substances and want to experiment with them.
4.	Mental health issues: Young people with mental health problems, such as depression or anxiety, are more likely to abuse substances.


## Julianna’s Story
Julianna started experimenting with cigarettes when she was 14 years old. She was part of a group of students at her boarding school who were considered cool. Every Saturday night, the group of five would hide behind the science laboratory and share a cigarette. By the time Julianna turned 16, the group had started dabbling in marijuana and alcohol. Unfortunately, Julianna became an addict and did not complete her education.

Julianna's story is not uncommon. What starts off as a youthful dalliance could end in a vicious cycle of substance dependency, costing young people their education and derailing their future. 

## HAZEYouth’s Approach
At HAZEYouth, we aim to educate our youth about the risks and offer healthier alternatives for stress management and social interaction. We provide safe, inclusive environments, both digitally and physically, for young people to interact, learn, and maintain their mental wellness. Our digital safe space, available 24/7 on Discord, offers a platform for young people to share experiences, learn, and heal.

## Sexual Exploitation: The Dangers of Transactional Sex and Intergenerational Relationships 
The HAZEYouth survey identified transactional sex, intergenerational relationships, and irresponsible sexual activity as notable challenges, with 15.2% of respondents highlighting these issues. Transactional sex, the exchange of sexual favours for money, goods, or services, often finds a breeding ground among young people in vulnerable situations due to poverty or homelessness. Intergenerational relationships, involving sexual engagements between an adult and a minor, pose a risk as minors lack the necessary resources to protect themselves from exploitation and abuse. Irresponsible sexual activity, characterized by a lack of precaution to prevent pregnancy and STIs, can lead to unintended pregnancies and the spread of infections like HIV/AIDS.

These challenges can have profound impacts on young people's lives, leading to physical, mental health issues, educational hurdles, and an increased susceptibility to violence and exploitation. Contributing factors to these challenges include poverty, which may push young people towards transactional sex or intergenerational relationships for survival, lack of education making them prone to irresponsible sexual activity, and societal norms and peer influences that may pressure young people into premature or unprotected sexual engagements. Addressing these challenges necessitates a holistic approach involving education, support, and the fostering of safe spaces for discussion and resolution.

## Tariro's Struggle
Tariro was a bright and ambitious 17-year-old with dreams of a better future. But when her family fell on hard times, she was forced to make a difficult choice: trade her dignity for financial stability. She entered into a relationship with a man almost twice her age. He promised her the world, but his promises were empty. He was controlling and manipulative, and he used his power over her to exploit her emotionally and physically.

Tariro knew that she was in a dangerous situation, but she felt trapped. She was afraid of what would happen if she left him. She was also afraid of what her family and friends would think.
One day, Tariro finally gathered the courage to break free. She reached out for help, and with the support of her loved ones, she began to rebuild her life.

Tariro's story is a reminder that we all have the power to choose our own path. Even in the darkest of times, there is always hope.

## HAZEYouth’s Approach
HAZEYouth champions comprehensive sexual education, awareness-raising campaigns, and peer support networks to combat these problems. We aim to create environments where young people can openly discuss these issues and seek help without fear of judgment.

## Cyberbullying: The Online Nightmare 
Cyberbullying is a grim reality for 16.3% of the respondents. Defined as bullying that occurs through digital devices like cell phones, computers, and tablets, cyberbullying can transpire via SMS, text, apps, or online platforms such as social media, forums, or gaming environments where individuals can view, participate in, or share content.

Cyberbullying can take many forms, including: 
1.	Sending mean or threatening messages 
2.	Posting embarrassing photos or videos 
3.	Spreading rumors or lies 
4.	Impersonating someone online 
5.	Excluding someone from online groups

Cyberbullying is a serious problem that can have a devastating impact on young people. It can lead to depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, and even suicidal thoughts or actions. Cyberbullies often hide behind the veil of digital anonymity, which makes it difficult to track them down and stop them. This can make cyberbullying even more insidious and harmful. That's why it's so important to talk to young people about cyberbullying and to take steps to prevent it. We need to create a safer digital world for our children.

## Sarah’s Ordeal
Sarah's world turned upside down when she discovered an anonymous account posting altered photos of her online. The photos were mortifying, and the comments were even worse. Sarah felt like she was being watched and judged 24/7. She tried to ignore the account, but it was impossible. 

The photos and comments were everywhere, even at school. Sarah started to dread going to class and her grades suffered. She felt isolated and alone. One day, Sarah finally broke down and told her parents what was happening. They were devastated and supportive. They helped Sarah report the account to the school and to the police. It took time and effort, but Sarah eventually healed from her ordeal. She learned to speak up about online bullying and to support other victims. 

Sarah's story is a reminder that we all have a role to play in creating a safe and supportive online community.

## HAZEYouth’s Approach
Our programmes focus on online etiquettes, responsible digital citizenship, and support structures to help victims of cyberbullying regain their digital dignity.

## Social Media Addiction: The Pressures of 24-hour Social Networking 
Continuous social media engagement is problematic for 8.7% of young people. Young people today are constantly connected to social media, and they may feel pressure to be available and responsive at all times. This can lead to a number of problems, including:
1.	Stress and anxiety: Young people who feel pressure to be constantly available on social media may experience stress and anxiety. This can make it difficult for them to focus in school, participate in activities, and form healthy relationships.
2.	Sleep deprivation: Young people who spend too much time on social media may experience sleep deprivation. This can lead to a number of physical and mental health problems, such as irritability, difficulty concentrating, and mood swings.
3.	Cyberbullying: Social media can be a breeding ground for cyberbullying. Young people who are cyberbullied may experience depression, anxiety, and even suicidal thoughts.
4.	FOMO (fear of missing out): Young people may feel pressure to keep up with their friends on social media. This can lead to FOMO, which can cause them to engage in risky or unhealthy behaviors.
5.	Unrealistic expectations: Social media often portrays unrealistic images of beauty and success. Young people who compare themselves to these images may develop low self-esteem and body image issues.


## Mark's Dilemma
Mark, a talented student, was addicted to social media. He constantly checked his phone for updates, fearing he would miss out on something important. This obsession was impacting his academic performance, social relationships, and sleep. Mark realized he had a problem and decided to take a break from social media for a week. At first, it was difficult, but he started to feel better as the week went on. He slept better, focused better, and spent more time with his loved ones. 

After the week was over, Mark decided to limit his social media use. He only allowed himself to check his phone for a few minutes each day and spent time doing other activities he enjoyed.
Mark eventually overcame his social media addiction and learned that it's okay to miss out on things sometimes. He also realized that his real life was more important than his online life.

## HAZEYouth’s Approach
We address the adverse effects of social media through digital literacy programmes that promote mindful engagement with online platforms. 

## The Bottom Line 
Our three-part journey has unveiled the intricate struggles faced by today's youth, from economic constraints to social pressures and mental health challenges. These are not merely isolated incidents but interconnected issues demanding a collective and sustained response.

HAZEYouth stands committed to empowering young minds to navigate these complexities through targeted interventions, workshops, and outreach programs. Our initiatives aim to foster informed decision-making, resilience, and positive contributions to their communities and society as a whole.

However, our efforts alone are not enough. We seek the involvement and support of parents, educators, policymakers, and society at large to create a nurturing environment where young people can flourish. Whether it's advocating for policy changes, volunteering your time, or simply engaging in open conversations with the youth around you, every action counts.

As we conclude this series, we extend a call to action. Reflect on what you can do to make a difference. Your actions, however small, could significantly impact a young person's life for the better. Let's join hands in not just highlighting the issues but being an active part of the solution. Together, we can build a more inclusive and supportive framework that allows every young person the opportunity to realize their full potential.
