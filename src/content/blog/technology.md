We live in a society that relies heavily on technology to improve our lives. Due to innovation, we can learn any new skill and research has been made more accessible. Whereas we may have many distractions due to social media, our foundation encourages all young people to learn and to have focus to improve ourselves.

 

Our goal as a Foundation is to empower young people and to create safe spaces both online and in-person, where we can share ideas and connect with youth with similar mind sets. With these safe places, we provide mentorship and easy access to learning materials. Our Foundation provides for freedom of expression so no one feels out of place. We ensure that everyone is comfortable.

 

I believe that we all can contribute to change. What we perhaps need is encouragement, companionship and mentorship. I encourage youth to join our Foundation because there is power in numbers. One of our Foundation’s objectives is to unleash young people’s creativity and innovation. Together, we can make a difference. Together, we can build a better world for tomorrow.
