## Introduction:
Explore the HAZEYouth Survey 2021 results, which highlight the diverse motivators for 218 young people. Discover what fuels the ambition and drive of today's youth. In analyzing the state of motivation among young people, the HAZEYouth Survey 2021 presents a revealing picture. A substantial 32.6% of respondents report high motivation, indicating a strong drive and eagerness to pursue their goals. This is complemented by a further 25.6% who claim very high motivation, showcasing an even more intense determination to succeed. 

On the other side of the spectrum, a smaller yet noteworthy 10.6% of young people experience very low motivation, alongside 8.7% with low motivation, signaling areas where support and intervention may be necessary. Additionally, 21.5% of participants report an average level of motivation, suggesting a potential for growth with the right encouragement and opportunities.

These statistics form the basis for understanding the various levels of motivation within the youth demographic and will guide HAZEYouth in crafting targeted strategies to bolster motivation where it's needed most. What motivates young people? The survey results reveal a multifaceted array of motivators, each reflecting a unique aspect of the young people’s mindset and priorities.

## Professional Drive and Financial Ambitions
In a landscape where career and financial success are often heralded as prime indicators of achievement, it's no surprise that a substantial 50.5% of young respondents in the HAZEYouth Survey 2021 align their motivation with professional aspirations. This segment of youth is not content with mere participation in the workforce; they are driven by a powerful urge to stand out and excel. Their ambitions are multifaceted, not restricted to ascending the traditional corporate hierarchy but encompassing a broader vision that includes initiating startups, disrupting industries with innovative ideas, and carving out niches in the competitive global marketplace. The motivation here is twofold: personal fulfillment through achieving professional milestones and the broader impact of contributing to economic growth and societal progress.

Furthermore, these career ambitions are not pursued in isolation but are closely linked to financial goals. For 16.7% of young people, financial literacy is not just about managing budgets but understanding the broader economic landscape. They aim to navigate the complex world of finance with acuity, recognizing that wealth is not merely accumulated but strategically built through informed investment decisions and entrepreneurial ventures. The goal of achieving financial independence is rooted in the pursuit of autonomy and the liberating sense of security that comes with sound financial management.

The drive for professional and financial success is not merely transactional for these young people. It's about the pride in one’s accomplishments, the satisfaction of personal goals, and the independence that financial stability can bring. This combined professional and financial drive is a potent force, one that fuels not just the pursuit of individual success but also the potential for broader economic innovation and societal contribution.

### Family Influence and Social Connections: The Foundations of Motivation
The complex dynamics of family relationships significantly shape the ambitions and motivations of 30.3% of young people, as revealed by the HAZEYouth Survey 2021.The family unit, often the primary social structure within which individuals grow and develop, provides more than just basic needs—it's the crucible for instilling values, nurturing talents, and instigating aspirations. Within the familial context, young people find not just a support system but also role models whose footsteps they seek to follow. Parents, siblings, and extended family members contribute to a young person's sense of identity, instilling a desire to achieve and contribute, perhaps as a means of reciprocation for the investment made in their futures.

Moreover, the influence of family extends to include a sense of responsibility and the drive to provide for loved ones, which can be powerful motivators for career choices and personal development. The aspirations nurtured within the family environment often reflect a blend of personal ambition and the wish to uplift one's family, underscoring the complex interplay between self-advancement and familial loyalty.

Simultaneously, nearly a fifth of young individuals, 19.9%, draw significant motivation from their social networks outside of the familial sphere. Friendships and romantic relationships provide support, presenting opportunities for personal growth, emotional fulfillment, and social integration. These connections serve as a mirror, reflecting back the potential that individuals might not see in themselves, and as a catalyst, encouraging them to step out of their comfort zones and engage with the broader community.

The value of these social ties lies not only in the joy and comfort they provide but also in their ability to challenge and inspire. Peers, mentors, and partners can introduce new perspectives, advocate for unconsidered paths, and provide the reassurance or validation that emboldens young people to pursue their dreams with vigor.

### Inspirational Forces and Individual Passions: Energizing the Youth
The HAZEYouth Survey 2021 identifies a significant group of young people, 19.3%, who find their drive in the success narratives of peers and leaders alike. Witnessing the accomplishments of others does more than just entertain; it energizes and encourages youth to set their own lofty goals and pursue them with tenacity. These stories of triumph often act as catalysts, sparking the desire for success and prompting youth to envision a trajectory of achievements for themselves.

Personal interests and hobbies also play a substantial role in motivating youth, with 18.3% of respondents finding joy and drive in activities that fuel their creativity and satisfy their curiosity. Whether it's through music, art, technological ventures, or travel, these pursuits are more than mere pastimes; they serve as sources of inspiration and incubators for innovation. They offer a means of self-expression and a way to explore one's identity, often leading to the discovery of new talents and the development of skills that can translate into professional opportunities.

Moreover, spiritual and religious convictions offer a solid foundation for motivation among 16.2% of the young people surveyed. These beliefs provide a guiding framework and a sense of purpose, helping individuals to navigate life's complexities and find solace in something greater than themselves. In a world where young people are bombarded with choices and information, spirituality and religion can offer a clear path and a stable ground from which to grow.

The ability to confront and surmount personal challenges is also a significant driving force for 13.9% of respondents. Overcoming obstacles not only builds character but also instills a sense of accomplishment and the knowledge that resilience is a key ingredient in the recipe for success. It is through these challenges that many young people learn their most valuable lessons and acquire the grit necessary to tackle future hurdles.

### Personal Growth and Educational Pursuits: Expanding Horizons
Personal growth is a key motivator for 21.6% of respondents in the HAZEYouth Survey 2021. This commitment to self-development is an ongoing process that involves nurturing self-esteem, bolstering confidence, and diligently working towards personal aspirations. It's a reflective journey where setting and achieving personal milestones is just as important as the accolades received along the way. Young people are dedicating themselves to this personal evolution, recognizing that self-worth and personal fulfillment often precede external success.

Alongside this inner development, educational pursuits are equally crucial, with 17.0% of youth placing high value on the acquisition of knowledge. The motivation to learn goes beyond the confines of a classroom—it involves expanding one’s cognitive boundaries, engaging with a range of disciplines, and applying this knowledge constructively. In a world where information is readily available, the desire to sift through it, to absorb what is relevant, and to utilize it effectively is what sets apart those who are merely informed from those who are truly enlightened.

This educational drive is closely connected to a deeper understanding of the world and one’s place within it. It involves equipping oneself with the tools necessary to contribute to society meaningfully and to innovate within one’s field. The pursuit of knowledge is therefore twofold: it is a personal quest for intellectual fulfillment and a strategic endeavor to foster societal advancement.

### Additional Motivators 
In addition to the primary motivators identified, a smaller yet insightful percentage of youth find their drive in areas that reflect a conscientious approach to life. Among these, 5.0% are motivated by a profound respect for nature and the environment, indicating a commitment to ecological stewardship and sustainability. The motivation from health and well-being is evident in 3.5% of respondents, underscoring the importance of physical and mental fitness in their pursuit of success. Meanwhile, 2.8% of respondents are driven by unique motivations that did not fall into larger categories, often bespoke amalgamations of personal experiences and aspirations. Lastly, even though a modest 0.6% are fueled by their inspirational and personal values, it’s a potent reminder of the depth and diversity in the motivations of young individuals, where even the less common sources of inspiration are pivotal to the overall tapestry of youth motivation.
