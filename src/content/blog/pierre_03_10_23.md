## Introduction
in the transition from youth to adulthood, numerous challenges serve as hurdles to the progress and well-being of young individuals. At HAZEYouth, a 2021 online survey revealed 12 economic and social challenges that today's young generation faces. This post focuses on the first set of these challenges, shedding light on the harsh realities of unemployment, materialism, peer pressure, and parental expectations. The chart below displays the percentage of respondents who identified each challenge as a significant concern in their lives.

## Youth Unemployment: A Harsh Reality 
Unemployment emerges as a significant challenge experienced by young people today. According to the HAZEYouth 2021 baseline survey, a remarkable 81.5% of respondents identified lack of employment opportunities as a major hurdle. Indeed, one out of five respondents (19.2%) who were out of school were unemployed at the time of the survey.

Consider the case of Sandra, which mirrors the experience of many young people. Sandra graduated from a prestigious university with a bachelor's degree in economics, followed by an MBA. Five years later, she is still struggling to find employment, despite having applied to many organizations.

## Sandra’s situation unveils several challenges that young people often face in the job market: 
•	Competition from a large pool of qualified candidates: The job market is saturated with qualified candidates, making it difficult for individuals to stand out, regardless of their qualifications. 
•	Lack of experience: Many employers seek candidates with experience, yet gaining this experience becomes a catch-22 situation when no one is willing to provide that initial opportunity. 
•	Discrimination due to age or lack of experience: At times, despite having the necessary qualifications, young individuals may face discrimination due to their age or perceived lack of experience, further narrowing their employment prospects.

## At HAZEYouth:
We acknowledge that unemployment can take a devastating toll on the mental health of young people. The feeling of inadequacy, anxiety, and depression can be overwhelming. That's where we come in. Our programs are designed to build mental resilience and well-being in young people. We equip them with the coping mechanisms and supportive community they need to navigate through these challenging times. While we may not directly improve job prospects, our holistic approach fosters a sense of self-efficacy and optimism. These are essential qualities for overcoming the challenges posed by unemployment and other adversities.

## The Material World: The Pressures of Materialism on Young People
Materialism, the relentless pursuit of possessions and wealth, presents a challenge for young people. Today's media and society often send messages suggesting that the latest clothes, gadgets, and experiences are key to happiness and success. This notion was acknowledged by nearly three out of 10 respondents (27.2%) in the HAZEYouth survey.

## This belief can lead to several problems for young people, such as:
•	Financial Stress: Trying to keep up with the latest trends can lead to financial stress for young people. This could result in debt and other financial issues.
•	Low Self-Esteem: When young people feel they don’t own the right things, it can lead to low self-esteem. This can affect their ability to form healthy relationships and perform well in school or at work.
•	Mental Health Problems: The pressure to have more can contribute to mental health issues like depression and anxiety. In severe cases, it could even lead to self-harm or suicide.

## At HAZEYouth:
We recognise the detrimental impact of materialism and aim to inculcate a sense of value-based living among young people. Through workshops and interactive sessions, we strive to shift the focus from material possessions to self-worth, personal values and meaningful relationships.

## Fitting In: The Negative Consequences of Peer Pressure
Fitting In: The Negative Consequences of Peer Pressure One in four young people interviewed (25%) identified peer pressure as a challenge. The concern here is not about positive peer pressure, which can encourage young people to engage in healthy behaviors like studying diligently, partaking in extracurricular activities, or displaying kindness towards others. The focus is on negative peer pressure that can lead young people into harmful behaviors, which, in turn, can have severe impacts on their physical and mental health, along with their future prospects.

Young individuals find peer pressure challenging, particularly because they are at a stage of their lives where they are developing their own identities and trying to fit in with their peers. This can make them more susceptible to pressures from friends to indulge in risky or harmful behaviors such as substance abuse, unprotected sex, or criminal activity.

## Several factors can heighten a young person's susceptibility to peer pressure, including:
•	Low self-esteem: Young people with low self-esteem are more likely to give in to peer pressure because they are afraid of being rejected or ridiculed by their friends.
•	Lack of confidence: Young people who lack confidence in their ability to make their own decisions are more likely to be swayed by peer pressure.
•	Need for belonging: Young people have a strong need to belong to a group and feel accepted by their peers. This can make them more likely to go along with the group, even if they don't feel comfortable with it.

## At HAZEYouth:
Peer pressure can steer young individuals off the right path. At HAZEYouth, we create a supportive community that encourages positive peer interactions. Through coaching and mentorship, we aim to build self-confidence and decision-making skills among the youth, empowering them to resist negative influences.

## Parental Expectations: The Weight of Parental Pressure
The weight of parental expectations is a reality for many young individuals, with 23.9% of respondents in the HAZEYouth survey citing parental pressure as a challenge. This pressure can manifest as a source of stress, anxiety, and overwhelm, potentially fermenting resentment and sparking conflict between parents and their children. The motives behind parental pressure can vary; some parents might be channeling their own unfulfilled aspirations through their children, others may be driven by concerns for their child's future, desiring to provide them with the best possible opportunities. There are also parents whose intentions are rooted in protecting their children from adversities.

## Illustrating this is a poignant narrative:
 "My parents wanted me to become a medical doctor. My dream was to become a musician. They forced me into the sciences. I rebelled, disengaged, and eventually dropped out of school." 
In another case, while pursuing her university education, Vicky's recurring conversations with her parents revolved around finding a suitable man for marriage. Their rationale was twofold: firstly, the university environment provided a pool of eligible bachelors, and secondly, they believed that a woman's 'marketability' for marriage dwindles with age. The expectation was for Vicky to graduate not just with an academic diploma, but with a marital one too.

Yielding to her parents’ insistence, Vicky got engaged to Chris, a choice she might not have considered under different circumstances. The narrative unfolded as expected; she married Chris in line with her parents' wishes. However, the ink had barely dried on their second wedding anniversary card when their marriage crumbled. The cracks stemmed from a mismatch in values and life aspirations, leading to an unending string of conflicts.

Both stories amplify the emotional toll and the long-term repercussions that parental pressure can inflict. They beckon a reflection on the importance of nurturing a supportive environment where young individuals can make life decisions that resonate with their personal values and aspirations, rather than being steered by external expectations.

## At HAZEYouth:
We empower young people to contend with parental pressure, among other challenges. While we do not deal directly with parents, our programs are designed to equip young individuals with the skills and support they need to effectively communicate their own aspirations and concerns, fostering a sense of understanding and mutual respect within the family setting.

## The Bottom Line
The journey from youth to adulthood is laden with challenges. The first step towards alleviating these issues is understanding their root causes and manifestations. At HAZEYouth, we are committed to shedding light on these challenges and providing a supportive environment for young individuals to thrive despite them. The subsequent post will delve into the mental and emotional challenges that young people face, providing insight into how we, as a society, can foster a more supportive and empowering environment for the youth.
