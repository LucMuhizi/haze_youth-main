Not quite everlasting;
So don’t waste your life;
Live it to the fullest;
But don’t throw it all away."

---Life is a fountain of youth;  
Not quite everlasting;  
So don’t waste your life;  
Live it to the fullest;  
But don’t throw it all away.  

Life is what you make it;  
Know who you are;  
Your values and vices;  
Your strengths and weaknesses;  
Your truth and story;  
Don’t try to fit in but add to.  

Life is a dance;  
The music will eventually stop;  
So don’t speed through it;  
Enjoy every moment;  
Even the missteps.  

Life is a lesson;  
Mistakes experienced;  
Fake friends made;  
Wrong turns taken;  
When we almost break,  
But we keep learning.  

We have to not only believe but know that we have that spark in us.
