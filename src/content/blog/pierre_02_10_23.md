Have you ever been turned away from an opportunity solely because of your age? It's a question that resonates with many of us, whether we're just starting out in our careers, navigating the complexities of middle age, or embracing the wisdom that comes with growing older. Age discrimination is a subtle but pervasive issue, significantly shaping our experiences. This blog post shines a spotlight on young people, an often-overlooked demographic in age discrimination conversations.

The Unspoken Struggles of Youth
Are young people merely "future leaders," or are they current leaders stifled by today's unfair treatment? As Malala Yousafzai, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and advocate for girls' education argued, "Young people are not just the leaders of tomorrow; they are the influencers of today. They are driving change and shaping the world around them in ways that have never been possible before." Our 2021 survey uncovers the challenges young people face, from job discrimination to societal stigmas.

The Real Deal: Unmasking Age Discrimination among Young People
Interested in the extent of ageism among the youth? So were we. We conducted an online survey with 97 participants. The majority were male, most were either students or employed. The numbers were staggering: age discrimination affects a shocking 62.5% of our respondents. Moreover, forms like social stigma and economic challenges such as underpayment also emerge.

Types of Discrimination Reported by Young People
1.	Being denied job opportunities: 25%
2.	Stereotyping: 20%
3.	Disrespect and Underestimation: 15%
4.	Being paid less for equal work: 10%
5.	Bullying and domestic violence: 5%
6.	Sexual harassment: 5%

Why Are Jobs So Hard to Come By for the Youth?
Ever been turned down for a job because of your age? You belong to the 25% who have. Imagine being labelled "too young" for a job you are perfectly qualified for. Ageism in the workplace is not just about a lost paycheck; it also stifles financial independence and career growth.

Examples of Employment Discrimination
1.	"I was rejected in a job interview because I looked too young."
2.	"An older man accused me of things I had not done merely because I resisted his harassment."
3.	"I scored highest in a job interview but was told I was too young for the position."

Shattering Stereotypes: Youth Are Not Just Inexperienced Kids
Felt underestimated due to your age? About 20% of young people have. Ban Ki-moon, former secretary-general of the United Nations, says, "Young people are the future, and their wisdom and insights are essential to solving the challenges we face today. We must listen to their voices and give them a seat at the table." Stereotypes branding young people as naive can severely limit their societal contributions. 

Examples of Negative Stereotyping
1.	"I was considered too young to understand and was denied an opportunity to serve as a workers' representative in the trade union."
2.	"People assume I lack knowledge due to my age. During staff meetings, older colleagues often silence me, saying my time to speak will come."

The Respect Gap: Why Do Older People Look Down on Youth?
Have you ever felt belittled or disrespected because of your age? Nearly 15% of survey respondents have. The reasons for this generational disconnect could be multiple—ingrained prejudices, entitlement, or perhaps, a sheer lack of awareness.

Examples of Disrespect and Underestimation
1.	"When younger, older people presumed I lacked knowledge and interrupted me during presentations."
2.	"I was called 'jajja' because I acted older than my age, causing body shaming and isolating me."

Call to Action: If you've felt disrespected due to your age, consider speaking up respectfully but firmly. Let's challenge these norms together.

The Pay Gap: Why Are Young People Paid Less for Equal Work?
Did you know that 10% of young people feel underpaid compared to older colleagues? It is disheartening, especially when this impacts life milestones like home ownership or starting a family.

Examples of Financial Inequity
1.	"I receive inferior payment for excellent work compared to older colleagues. I was denied a salary increase because I was considered too young to have financial responsibilities."
2.	"We are often short of money and continue to depend on our parents, even when employed."

The Hidden Scourge: Bullying and Domestic Violence
A troubling 5% report experiences of bullying and domestic violence, shedding light on the emotional burden stemming from family discouragement or unjust treatment.

Examples of Bullying and Domestic Violence
1.	“My stepmother withholds food from me claiming I’m overweight and yet I’m much smaller, and even younger, than my half-sister.”
2.	“My father always tells me that I will never make it in life. This is because I failed to get employment two years after completing school, which was frustrating and caused me to instead stay at home.”

Has Sexual Harassment Touched Your Life, Too? 
It's disheartening to report that 5% of respondents have experienced sexual harassment, with some even receiving derogatory comments about their appearance. Young people find themselves particularly susceptible to these unwanted advances, be it at school, in the workplace, or just walking down the street.

So what forms does this harassment take? Well, here are some common scenarios:
1.	Creating a Hostile Environment: Ever felt uncomfortable or unsafe at work or school because of persistent sexual comments, jokes, or advances? That's what we mean by a hostile environment. It's both unprofessional and deeply damaging.
2.	Quid Pro Quo Harassment: Ever been put in a position where sexual favors are expected in return for job benefits or better grades? It's a manipulation of power dynamics, and it's utterly unacceptable.
3.	Retaliation: And let's not forget those instances where refusing such advances leads to negative consequences, like poor grades or job loss. Retaliation is not only unethical but also illegal in many jurisdictions.

Examples of Sexual Harassment
1.	"I have experienced more than my share of unwanted whistling, catcalling, and verbal abuse while walking on the street. Sometimes it's about my hair; other times, it's because of my short skirt. There's even one guy who always asks if I'm married!"
2.	"An older man using his power and authority to accuse me for things I hadn't done just because I stood my ground to resist his sexual harassment."

Your Age Is Not a Barrier
So, what can you do to challenge these issues? We've discussed different forms of unfair treatment. Now let's focus on how young people can challenge, address, or mitigate its impact.

1.	Being Denied Job Opportunities: Don't let a 'no' dishearten you. Instead, build a portfolio that speaks volumes about your skills. Network, seek internships, and don't shy away from entry-level roles that offer valuable experience. Sometimes, the best defense against age discrimination is undeniable competence.

2.	Stereotyping: The next time someone tries to box you into an age-related stereotype, challenge it. Speak up, share your viewpoints, and show that wisdom isn't solely the preserve of older persons. Your fresh perspective can be a much-needed change in many settings.

3.	Disrespect and Underestimation: It's disheartening to be dismissed because of your age, but let your work speak for itself. Consistently delivering quality work can make naysayers rethink their preconceptions.

4.	Being Paid Less for Work of the Same Value: This is a tough one but gather evidence. If you can prove that you are being paid less for equal work, take it up with human resources or consult an employment rights organisation. Know your worth and stand up for it.

5.	Bullying and Domestic Violence: No one should have to endure bullying or violence. Confide in someone you trust and look for avenues of support. There are organisations and helplines dedicated to helping victims. Don't suffer in silence; seek the help you deserve.

6.	Sexual Harassment: This is non-negotiable. No one should have to endure this kind of behavior. Report any incidents to the appropriate authority, whether it's school administration, your workplace, or even the police. It's time for a collective stand against sexual harassment.


Age might be a number, but your experiences, skills, and contributions are not. Don't let age-based discrimination hold you back. Challenge it, address it, and rise above it.
The Last Word
Discrimination based on age affects numerous life aspects. It's vital to work towards an inclusive society where young people are valued for their contributions, not their age.
