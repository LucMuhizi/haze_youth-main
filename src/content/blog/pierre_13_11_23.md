## Introduction
Are we truly listening to the youth of today? How do they see their role in a world that's constantly evolving? As the torchbearers of tomorrow, it’s crucial that young voices are not only heard but amplified. The HAZEYouth Survey 2021 ventured into the heart of this demographic to understand their aspirations and the realities they face. Surveying 218 young people, split almost evenly between women (47.2%) and men (52.8%), we sought to capture a snapshot of their innermost thoughts and feelings. The insights gained go beyond simple numbers; they are pivotal for shaping HAZEYouth's future strategies and actions

## Understanding Youth Voice and Choice
In a world clamoring with voices, do the youngest among us feel heard? This is the question HAZEYouth set out to answer with its 2021 survey. With an average score of 3.67 out of 5, the data painted a cautiously optimistic picture: a majority of young people feel that their opinions carry weight. But what does this number truly tell us? 

For one, it speaks of potential—of a platform that's present but could be elevated. With 55% indicating they feel heard, the glass is more than half full, yet not brimming. The 24% who 'strongly agree' suggests a core of young people who are deeply engaged and feel acknowledged. However, the 31% 'agree' response hints at a more passive acknowledgment, a sign that while youth feel their voices resonate, there may be room for broadening their reach and deepening their impact.

The flip side reveals a combined 29% who 'disagree' or 'strongly disagree,' unveiling a gap where voices are fading into the background. It's a gap that HAZEYouth acknowledges and is determined to bridge. Why do these young people feel marginalized, and how can we, as a community, turn the tide? 

This is where HAZEYouth steps in—by not only hearing but actively listening. By providing platforms where young opinions lead to action, we can transform this silent minority into a chorus of change-makers. 

HAZEYouth's current initiatives already provide a springboard for youth empowerment. But the survey's insights underscore the need to delve deeper. Exploring new avenues for engagement, such as digital town halls or youth advisory panels, could be the key to ensuring no voice goes unheard. By strengthening communication channels, HAZEYouth is committed to not just uplifting these voices but also to ensuring they are integral in scripting the narrative of their generation."

## The Power of Choice in Youth Empowerment
Choice is the cornerstone of freedom and a critical aspect of empowerment. The ability to make decisions about one's own life is a defining factor in personal development and societal contribution. The HAZEYouth Survey 2021 revealed that a resounding 74.1% of young people feel they can exercise choice in their life decisions, a testament to their autonomy and independence. However, the 17.6% who remained neutral and the 8.3% who disagreed highlight the complexities of choice in the youth experience.

HAZEYouth takes these insights to heart, recognizing that true empowerment comes from the ability to make informed choices. As such, efforts to provide comprehensive information, resources, and support systems are imperative to empower all youth to make choices confidently. It is not enough to merely present options; HAZEYouth aims to equip young people with the necessary tools to assess and make those choices wisely.

##Self-Esteem and Confidence: The Inner Foundation of Empowerment
Empowerment begins within. How young people perceive themselves can set the stage for their interaction with the world. It's like the roots of a tree – the deeper and stronger they are, the higher and more resilient the tree grows. So what does the HAZEYouth Survey tell us about the roots our youth are growing?

The data is heartening: a substantial 64.8% report high to very high self-esteem, with a similar pattern mirrored in self-confidence levels. These are the young people who stand tall, ready to face the world head-on. They are the dreamers, the doers, the potential leaders of tomorrow. But they are not the entire forest. A significant 29.6% consider their self-esteem to be average, a reminder that not all are on solid ground. And then there are those at the fringes – the 5.6% with low self-esteem and a similar minority with low confidence – who are the most vulnerable, often overshadowed by the more robust trunks around them.

HAZEYouth sees these findings as a call to action. It's not enough to cheer on the strong; we must nurture every seedling. Programs that boost self-esteem and confidence – from leadership workshops to mentorship pairings – are not just beneficial; they are essential. By bolstering these internal strengths, HAZEYouth can help transform the uncertain whispers of 'maybe I can' into the resounding assertion of 'I know I can.'"

## Motivation: The Fuel for Action
Motivation is the fuel that drives us forward, the spark that ignites action. It's a critical component of empowerment, and understanding its levels in young people is key to tapping into their potential. The survey reveals that the majority of young people – an inspiring 59.2% – are operating on high to very high motivation. This suggests that most of the young people surveyed are driven and likely to engage actively in pursuits that interest them. They are ready to be mobilized, their energy harnessed into meaningful change. 

A not-insignificant 21.6%, reports "Average" motivation, which may imply a fluctuating or context-dependent sense of drive. And then there are the 19.3% with low to very low motivation, which could be a concern if it affects their ability to achieve personal goals or contributes to disengagement.

HAZEYouth recognizes this disparity and understands that motivation is not a fixed attribute; it's a variable state that can be enhanced. By identifying what inspires our youth – from family and personal passions to financial and career goals – we can tailor programs that ignite their motivation. Whether it's through providing platforms for their voices to be heard, opportunities for career development, or support for their personal and financial aspirations, HAZEYouth is poised to be the catalyst that transforms latent potential into kinetic energy.

## Concluding Thoughts: Harnessing the Data for Change
The HAZEYouth Survey 2021 provides the foundational data for strategic planning and action. It clearly shows where young people excel and where they need more resources and attention. HAZEYouth is poised to enhance its programs, directly responding to the feedback from young people.

By utilizing this data, HAZEYouth is set to broaden its initiatives to empower youth more effectively. Our aim is to ensure young voices not only resonate within our organization but also play a crucial role in shaping our actions. We are focusing on key areas such as improving financial literacy, advancing technological understanding, boosting self-esteem, and igniting motivation — all to foster an environment where every young person has the opportunity to succeed and grow.

Looking ahead, we must shift from simply hearing to actively responding. The insights from our youth are clear, and it's time for us to take decisive action. HAZEYouth is at the forefront, and we encourage you to be a part of this empowering journey. By supporting our youth, we're building a stronger future together.
